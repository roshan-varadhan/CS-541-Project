0,"1. Missing value for 'RM' (located at index 'RM')
    2. Inconsistent value for 'RM' in previous rows (this data row is part of a larger dataset, and 'RM' values for nearby rows are not missing)
    3. Inconsistent value for 'MEDV' (24.0 is significantly lower than the expected median value for this area)
    4. Inconsistent value for 'LSTAT' (4"
1,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' has a value of 0.0, but this value is not consistent with the other data points in the dataset. 'CHAS' is a binary feature that should have a value of either 0 or 1. This is located in the third column of the dictionary.

2,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' should be either 0 or 1, but it is currently 0.0. This is located in the third column of the dictionary.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'NOX' should be a numerical value, but it is currently a decimal value (0.469"
3,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'B' has an inconsistent value. While 'B' is a numerical value in the rest of the dataset, it is represented as a string in this row. This is located in the 14th column of the dictionary.

4,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' has a value of 0.0, which is unexpected as the 'CHAS' variable represents whether a particular street is in a chasm-prone area. This is located in the third column of the dictionary.

5,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located at the second index of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' should be either 0 or 1, but it is currently 0.0. This is located at the fourth index of the dictionary.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'NOX' should be a numerical value, but it is currently a decimal value (0.458"
6,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether a neighborhood is in a chasm or not. However, the value is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value. Location: 'CHAS' column.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'RM' should be a measure of the average number of rooms per dwelling. However, the value is 6.012, which is not"
7,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether a particular property is located in a region with a significant amount of Charles River pollution. In this case, the value is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'MEDV' should be a continuous numerical value representing the median value of owner-occupied homes in a given census tract. In this case, the"
8,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether a given property is located in an area prone to flooding. However, this value is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value. This issue is located in the 'CHAS' key.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'AGE' should be the median value of houses in a given area, but this value is 100."
9,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether a given property is located in a region with a significant amount of Charles River pollution. However, the value for 'CHAS' in this row is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value. This could potentially cause issues in any analysis that relies on the 'CHAS' variable.
