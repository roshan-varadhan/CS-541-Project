0,"1. Missing value for 'RM' (located at index 'RM')
    2. Inconsistent value for 'RM' as it should be a numerical value, but is currently 'nan' (located at index 'RM')
    3. Inconsistent value for 'DIS' as it should be a numerical value, but is currently '4.09' (located at index 'DIS')
    4. Inconsistent value for 'MEDV"
1,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. It should be a numerical value, but instead, it is 0.0. This could be due to a mistake in data entry or a missing value in the original dataset.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' is also missing a value, but in this case, it is represented by a 0.0 instead of a null value. This could be a mistake in data cleaning or form"
2,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' should be either 0 or 1, but it is currently 0.0. This is located in the third column of the dictionary.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'NOX' should be a numerical value, but it is currently a decimal value (0.469"
3,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. Its location is in the dictionary key 'ZN'.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' should be either 0 or 1, but it is 0.0, which is a floating-point number. Its location is in the dictionary key 'CHAS'.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'B' is a float value instead of an integer. Its location is in"
4,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the row.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' is a boolean variable that should be either 0 or 1. However, the value in this row is 0.0, which is not a valid boolean value. This is located in the fourth column of the row.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'NOX' should be"
5,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value. This is located in the second column of the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'CHAS' has a value of 0.0, but this variable is a binary feature that should take a value of either 0 or 1. This is located in the third column of the dictionary.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'B' has a value of 394."
6,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary value (0 or 1), but it is 0.0, which is not a valid value. Location: 'CHAS' column.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'B' should be a numerical value, but it is 395.6, which is not a valid numerical value. Location: 'B' column.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'LSTAT'"
7,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether a given parcel is located in a region with Charles River (the river separating Cambridge from Boston) or not. However, the value for 'CHAS' in this row is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value. This could be a data entry error or a missing value, as the original dataset does not have any parcel located in the Charles River"
8,"1. Missing value: The 'MEDV' value is 16.5, which is not a valid numerical value for median house prices. This could be due to an error in data entry or a mistake in the data source. Location: 'MEDV' key in the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: The 'AGE' value is 100.0, which is an unusually high value for the age of a house. This could be due"
9,"1. Missing value: 'CHAS' should be a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether a particular location is in a 'CHAS'-protected area. However, the value for this variable is 0.0, which is not a valid binary value. This issue is located in the 'CHAS' key-value pair.
    2. Inconsistent value: The 'RM' value is 6.004, which is not a whole"
