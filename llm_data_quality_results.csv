    2. Inconsistent value: 'B' has a value of 394.63, which is significantly higher than any other value in the 'B' column. This is located in the last column of the data row.
    3. Inconsistent value: 'LSTAT' has a value of 2.94"
4,"1. Missing value: 'ZN' is missing a value, which could potentially impact the analysis. Location: 'ZN' key in the dictionary.
    2. Inconsistent value: 'NOX' has a value of 0.458, which could be an error as NOX levels are typically not zero. Location: 'NOX' key in the dictionary.
